Stravi-LIMS
===========

Stravi-LIMS is a LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) with a strong focus on SDM (Scientific Data Management) for all sizes of companies or organizations.
It has a strong focus on the product lifecycle of medical devices.

Working with diagnostics products results in rapidly increasing amounts of data and information, which need to be handled and organized. The use of a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is important in allowing intelligent management and organization of all data around manufacturing and application. Based on our and our partners' extended experience in fabrication and application around medical devices, we developed this system. It is designed for managing all pertinent issues in a diagnostics product life cycle.

Following items are reflected on the system: 
diagnostics disposables (cartridges), material (biochemical material, samples, plastics, other), protocols, experiments, images, imaging results, worklists, simple inventory management, equipment, electronic lab journals and data mining results.
